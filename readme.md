# ‚öîÔ∏è Nostr Hero

A web-based D&D-style RPG that generates your unique character from your Nostr identity and lets you adventure through a persistent world stored on Nostr relays.

## Overview

Nostr Hero is a nostalgic RPG experience that derives a deterministic character from your Nostr public key. Your cryptographic identity becomes an adventurer with unique stats, equipment, and abilities. The game combines classic D&D 5e mechanics with Nostr's decentralized protocol to create a persistent, cross-client RPG experience.

## Current Development Status (Pre-Alpha)

The game is currently in **very early pre-alpha development**. Most systems are planned or in initial implementation.

### ‚úÖ Implemented So Far

- **Deterministic Character Generation**:
  - Race, class, background, and alignment derived from Nostr pubkey
  - D&D 5e ability scores (STR, DEX, CON, INT, WIS, CHA)
  - Weighted distribution for realistic race/class combinations

- **Character Introduction System**:
  - Unique narrative introductions for each class/background combination
  - Contextual storytelling that reflects character origins
  - Atmospheric scene-setting with class-specific imagery

- **Starting Equipment System**:
  - Complex class-based equipment selection algorithm
  - Background-specific bonus equipment
  - Intelligent gear choices (e.g., spellcasters get component pouches, rangers get survival gear)
  - Deterministic selection ensures same character always gets same loadout

- **Starting Spell System**:
  - Class-specific spell lists for all spellcasting classes
  - Cantrip selection based on class mechanics
  - Level 1 spell loadout unique to each spellcaster
  - Spell slots properly allocated per class rules

- **Character Initialization**:
  - Starting HP calculated from class hit die + CON modifier
  - Starting mana derived from spellcasting ability + level
  - Starting gold based on class and background
  - All stats properly initialized and balanced

- **Game UI (Visual Only)**:
  - Dark Win95-themed retro interface with beveled edges
  - Tabbed panels: Equipment, Inventory, Spells, Quests, Stats, Music
  - Character stat display (HP, mana, fatigue, encumbrance bars)
  - Equipment slot visualization
  - Backpack grid (20 slots)
  - Spell slot interface
  - **Note**: UI displays save data but lacks interactive functionality

- **Content Database**:
  - 200+ items from D&D 5e SRD (weapons, armor, gear, tools)
  - Pixel art sprites (64x64) for items
  - Full D&D 5e spell database
  - Monster database
  - Location data
  - Item editor GUI tool for content creation

- **Save System (Basic)**:
  - Local JSON saves tied to npub
  - Save file generation from character creation
  - UI instantiation from save data

- **Authentication**:
  - Nostr login via NIP-07 browser extensions or Amber (Android)
  - Grain authentication client integration

### üöß Not Yet Implemented (Pre-Alpha ‚Üí Alpha Goals)

The following systems are **designed/specified** but need initial implementation:

- **Inventory System Logic**:
  - Moving items between slots
  - Equipping/unequipping gear
  - Item stacking
  - Weight/encumbrance calculations
  - Dropping/destroying items

- **Spell System Logic**:
  - Casting spells
  - Mana consumption
  - Spell slot tracking
  - Spell preparation mechanics

- **Game UI Interactivity**:
  - Clickable items
  - Drag-and-drop
  - Context menus
  - Tooltips with item details

- **Location System**:
  - Scene rendering
  - Location transitions
  - Environment traversal

- **Combat System**:
  - Turn-based combat
  - Dice rolling mechanics
  - Enemy AI
  - Loot drops

- **NPC Systems**:
  - NPC interactions
  - Dialogue system
  - Shops (buy/sell)
  - Storage systems
  - Inn/rest mechanics

### üìã Development Roadmap

#### Pre-Alpha ‚Üí Alpha Goals
Focus: **Core Gameplay Mechanics**

- Implement inventory management logic
- Implement spell casting and mana system
- Build location/scene system with navigation
- Create environment traversal mechanics
- Implement combat encounters
- Add basic NPC interactions (shop, storage, inn)
- Complete save/load functionality
- Playtesting and balance adjustments

#### Alpha ‚Üí Beta Goals
Focus: **Content & Nostr Integration**

- **Quest System**:
  - Handcrafted quest chains (all quests are manually designed)
  - Universal quests available to all players
  - Main story quests accessible regardless of character
  - Character-specific quests (race/class/background exclusive)
  - Exclusive quest rewards tailored to specific classes/roles
  - **Note**: No main story or critical content locked by character type

- **Full Nostr Integration**:
  - **Relay-based Saves**: Store save state as Nostr events (cross-client compatible)
  - **Save Validation**: Server validates saves against official list (modded vs unmodded tracking)
  - **Dungeon Master npub**: Official account for game announcements, player DMs, community engagement
  - **Nostr Badges**: Award achievements as NIP-58 badges
  - **Valid Saves List**: NIP-51 list event tracking legitimate save event IDs
  - **In-game Nostr Features**:
    - Write kind 1 notes using parchment and ink pen
    - Write long-form articles (kind 30023) using books
    - More creative integrations TBD

- **Cross-client Gameplay**:
  - Play on any Nostr Hero client with the same character
  - Community-built clients and mods
  - Official validation against canonical ruleset

## Tech Stack

### Backend (Go)
- **Web Server**: HTTP server with Go template rendering
- **Character Generation**: Deterministic algorithm based on Nostr pubkey
- **Authentication**: Grain client for Nostr auth (NIP-07, Amber)
- **API Endpoints**: REST API for game data, saves, and character info
- **Future**: DuckDB for analytics and event validation

### Frontend
- **Vanilla JavaScript**: Pure JS for game logic and state management
- **TailwindCSS**: Dark Win95-inspired retro theme
- **Go Templates**: Server-side rendering
- **Session Management**: Client-side Nostr session handling

### Data Format
