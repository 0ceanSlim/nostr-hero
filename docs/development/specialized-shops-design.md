## Implementation Notes

### Shop Mechanics
- All specialized shops work like general stores (buy/sell with limits)
- Each has their own gold pool and stock limits
- Gold regenerates daily
- Some shops may refuse to buy items outside their specialty
- **PRICING**: All shops use CHA-based pricing (see `shop-pricing-system.md`)
  - At CHA 20: Buy/sell at base value (100%)
  - At CHA 10: Sell for 50% / Buy at 150%
  - Scales linearly with CHA score
- Shop differentiation is by INVENTORY, not pricing

### NPC Personality Themes
- **Kingdom**: Professional, organized, class-conscious
- **Goldenhaven**: Cosmopolitan, business-minded, proud
- **Verdant**: Serene, nature-focused, wise
- **Ironpeak**: Gruff, practical, master craftsmen
- **Millhaven**: Friendly, creative, down-to-earth
- **Marshlight**: Direct, spiritual, warrior-focused

### District Placement
- Shops placed in existing districts with logical thematic fit
- Some districts will now have multiple shops (realistic for major cities)
- Villages keep it simple with 2 specialized shops each

## Next Steps

1. Create NPC JSON files for all 14 new merchants
2. Add shop buildings to location files
3. Update district NPC arrays
4. Define item inventories with stock limits for each shop
5. Backend implementation (shop state tracking, buy/sell logic)
