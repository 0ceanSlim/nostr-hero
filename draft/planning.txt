packs still needs work 

magic items to be added one at a time after base game is done

skills will be in the game but just cosmetic at demo

at character start
determine hp
hit die max + con modifier ((con-10)/3)
on level up you gain half your max hit die
so a  lv1 ranger has a base hp of 10 if he has con 12 then he gets 10+1 hp at lv1. At level 2 He would get 10+5+1
determine carry weight
(15 x str)
pick skills (available skills meet 12 minimum in the ability for the skill)

{
  "damage_modifier": {
    "base_stat": <character stat>,
    "formula": "(stat - 10) // 2",
  }
}

greatclub does 1d8 damage for instance so a character with 12 str would do 1d8+((12-10)/2)

so rolling a 4 would do 5 damage

sleeping also takes 1 rations
