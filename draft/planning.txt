packs still needs work 

magic items to be added one at a time after base game is done

skills will be in the game but just cosmetic at demo

at character start
determine hp
hit die max + con modifier ((con-10)/2)
on level up you gain half your max hit die
so a  lv1 ranger has a base hp of 10 if he has con 12 then he gets 10+1 hp at lv1. At level 2 He would get 10+5+1
determine carry weight
(15 x str)
pick skills (available skills meet 12 minimum in the ability for the skill)
You are an orphan and at the age of 18 after doing your background task for a fiew years you have no destiny other than your background
 and decide to discover your inner hero. 
someone from the cuty helped look after you while you grew up and they passed away promtpting this innitiative.
they Leave left you some items but you can't take it all. 
despese items and give choices
You take your necessary items
distribute starting equipment per class 
what additional gear will you bring?
and let character pick from options
from your time as a <background> you have <gp saved> 
as a <background> you start your jouney with <x gp> 
Distribute gold to inventory based on background
The local carriage agrees to take you to the inner kingdom to begin your journey

one ration to leave the kingdom and start exploring
after 4-10 activities (fights, exploratin, etc) you are prompted to keep going (a different enviornment) or return to the city
every time you return to the city you also have to pay some amount of gold to get in. 
(the player can always get into their starting city regardless of their wealth but not into other cities)
some ceties cost more to enter than others. 

can also take cart directly to a city for an amount of ration and gold

city entry fee can deduct from mint (bank)

different enviornment are different monsters

after a few enviornments you may reach another city with different NPCs. 

Expand the world through new locations.

tavern in town has a vip section with 1 free ale a day if the pubkey has a happytavern nip5

if they generated a legacy character add an easter egg

ranged weapon get str mod, mele wep gets dex mod. unless weapon is fenese then it usess dex. mod scales with level

{
  "damage_modifier": {
    "base_stat": <character stat>,
    "formula": "(stat - 10) // 2",
  }
}

greatclub does 1d8 damage for instance so a character with 12 str would do 1d8+((12-10)/2)

so rolling a 4 would do 5 damage

can't sleep unless you have a bedroll on you, sleeping regens 1/2 health
sleeping also takes 1 rations
