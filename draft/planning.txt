packs still needs work 

magic items to be added one at a time after base game is done

skills will be in the game but just cosmetic at demo

at character start
determine hp
hit die max + con modifier ((con-10)/2)
on level up you gain half your max hit die
so a  lv1 ranger has a base hp of 10 if he has con 12 then he gets 10+1 hp at lv1. At level 2 He would get 10+5+1
determine carry weight
(15 x str)
pick skills (available skills meet 12 minimum in the ability for the skill)
You are an orphan and at the age of 18 after doing your background task for a fiew years you have no destiny other than your background
 and decide to discover your inner hero. 
someone from the cuty helped look after you while you grew up and they passed away promtpting this innitiative.
they Leave left you some items but you can't take it all. 
despese items and give choices
You take your necessary items
distribute starting equipment per class 
what additional gear will you bring?
and let character pick from options
from your time as a <background> you have <gp saved> 
as a <background> you start your jouney with <x gp> 
Distribute gold to inventory based on background
The local carriage agrees to take you to the inner kingdom to begin your journey

one ration to leave the kingdom and start exploring
after 4-10 activities (fights, exploratin, etc) you are prompted to keep going (a different enviornment) or return to the city
every time you return to the city you also have to pay some amount of gold to get in. 
(the player can always get into their starting city regardless of their wealth but not into other cities)
some ceties cost more to enter than others. 

can also take cart directly to a city for an amount of ration and gold

city entry fee can deduct from mint (bank)

different enviornment are different monsters

after a few enviornments you may reach another city with different NPCs. 

Expand the world through new locations. 

plan demo to gain xp until 299 cap and warn that the demo doesn't have a level system yet

tavern in town has a vip section with 1 free ale a day if the pubkey has a happytavern nip5

if they generated a legacy character add an easter egg

ranged weapon get str mod, mele wep gets dex mod. unless weapon is fenese then it usess dex. mod scales with level

{
  "damage_modifier": {
    "base_stat": <character stat>,
    "formula": "(stat - 10) // 2",
  }
}

greatclub does 1d8 damage for instance so a character with 12 str would do 1d8+((12-10)/2)

so rolling a 4 would do 5 damage

can't sleep unless you have a bedroll on you, sleeping regens 1/2 health
sleeping also takes 1 rations

city has 3 links
town has 2 links

inbetween locations are predetermined enviornments that determine the monster you may run into

In the locations, there are centers and external parts of the city by their direction if they connect to another location

Special Weapons
Weapons with special rules are described here.

Lance. You have disadvantage when you use a lance to attack a target within 5 feet of you. Also, a lance requires two hands to wield when you aren’t mounted.
Net. A Large or smaller creature hit by a net is restrained until it is freed. A net has no effect on creatures that are formless, or creatures that are Huge or larger. A creature can use its action to make a DC 10 Strength check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach on a success. Dealing 5 slashing damage to the net (AC 10) also frees the creature without harming it, ending the effect and destroying the net. When you use an action, bonus action, or reaction to attack with a net, you can make only one attack regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make.

Silvered Weapons
Some monsters that have immunity or resistance to non-magical weapons are susceptible to silver weapons, so cautious adventurers invest extra coin to plate their weapons with silver. You can silver a single weapon or ten pieces of ammunition for 100 gp. This cost represents not only the price of the silver, but the time and expertise needed to add silver to the weapon without making it less effective.

Ammunition	You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack. Loading a one-handed weapon requires a free hand. At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield. If you use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an improvised weapon. A sling must be loaded to deal any damage when used in this way.
Finesse	When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.
Heavy	Creatures that are Small or Tiny have disadvantage on attack rolls with heavy weapons. A heavy weapon's size and bulk make it too large for a Small or Tiny creature to use effectively.
Light	A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons.
Loading	Because of the time required to load this weapon, you can fire only one piece of ammunition from it when you use an action, bonus action, or reaction to fire it, regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make.
Range	A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon’s normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon’s maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can’t attack a target beyond the weapon’s long range.
Reach	This weapon adds 5 feet to your reach when you attack with it. This property also determines your reach for opportunity attacks with a reach weapon.
Special	A weapon with the special property has unusual rules governing its use, explained in the weapon's description (See below)
Thrown	If a weapon has the thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the finesse property.
Two-Handed	This weapon requires two hands to use. This property is relevant only when you attack with the weapon, not when you simply hold it.
Versatile	This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property—the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.
