        Your Nostr public key, a unique string of characters identifying you in
        the decentralized Nostr network, is more than just an address. It's the
        seed for a personalized hero, a character whose fate is woven from the
        very fabric of your digital identity. This discovery transforms your key
        into a consistent and reproducible champion, allowing you to explore the
        possibilities hidden within your Nostr persona.

            <li>
              Your key is the foundation. It's fed into a deterministic
              algorithm, ensuring that every time you use the same key, you get
              the exact same hero.

          <ul class="list-disc ml-6 mt-2">
            <li>
              Your key determines your hero's race. This choice isn't arbitrary.
              Different races (Elves, Dwarves, Humans, etc.) have varying
              probabilities of being selected, reflecting inherent population
              distributions.

          <ul class="list-disc ml-6 mt-2">
            <li>
              The class of your hero (Wizard, Fighter, Rogue, etc.) is chosen
              based on your key, and the available classes are weighted.
            </li>
            <li>
              The race of your character effects the likely hood of a character
              being a certain class. Elves are more likely to be rangers for
              example.
            </li>
            <li>
              The chosen class then impacts the available background options and

            <li>
              Your hero's background (Noble, Criminal, Sage, etc.) adds depth to

            </li>
            <li>
              The possible backgrounds are based on the characters class. A
              criminal background is more likely for a rogue than a paladin.
            </li>
            <li>
              This background provides context for your hero's skills and

              Your hero's stats (Strength, Dexterity, Constitution,
              Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma) are rolled using a virtual dice
              system, mimicking traditional tabletop role-playing games.
            </li>
            <li>
              To maintain balance, stats are capped at 16 and floored at 8.
            </li>
            <li>
              Your chosen class imposes minimum stat requirements. For example,
              Wizards need at least 12 in Intelligence and Wisdom. These
              minimums ensure your hero is capable in their chosen profession.
            </li>
            <li>
              These stats determine your hero's strengths and weaknesses,

              other challenges.
